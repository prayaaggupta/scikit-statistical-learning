# scikit-statistical-learning
Inspired by the [Kaggle Instant Gratification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instant-gratification) I wanted to write some templates for users that want to have a easier learning curve with regards to statistical learning. These provide for the simplest aspects of machine learning.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression deals with one-dimensional correlations between given X input values and an output Y value.

## Logistic Regression

Logistic regression uses a logistic function in order to map a set of X input variables into a boolean Y value, such as is sick or is not sick.

## Quadratic Discriminant Analysis

QDA is uses two or more classes of objects or events by a quadric surface. It is a more generalized (i.e. somewhat improved) version of a linear classifier.

## Gaussian Mixture Model

GMMs are used in order to adequately group distributions of Gaussian distributions.
